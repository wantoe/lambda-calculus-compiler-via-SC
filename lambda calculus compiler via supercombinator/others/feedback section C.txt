Comments:

Quite a nice section on supercombinators with good use of examples. I
didn't quite grasp why supercombinators are good for compilation,
other than not having free variables.
You didn't say what the lambda to SKI transformation was for or how S,
K and I correspond to lambda terms. Generally I would have liked more
detail on combinatory logic. 
Essay and references are well presented

Lambda-lifting, supercombinators [4/4]
